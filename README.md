Title of Project: Analyzing & Comparing Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Access in Refugee Camps and Non-Refugee Regions in Tanzania and Rwanda 

## Background

This project was done for Emory's Data Science Club Projects Teams, and was presented as a poster in several symposiums. I worked with a team
of 4 people in the club to collaborate with a CDC employee who was examining water and sanitation access in refugee vs non refugee communities 
in sub-saharan Africa. My contribution to the project was examining the sanitation access in Tanzania and creating a visual 
depicting one of the variables from the given datasets. 

In this repository, I have added my code and visual, along with some other visuals and code I created on water access, but were not
in the final poster.
